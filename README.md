## Mini-lennium Falcon

### Background

Mini-lennium Falcon is a spin off of the classic game Helicopter crossed over with the beloved, legendary starship the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars series. Fly Han and Chewbacca through space, avoiding asteroids, comets and other space debris coming your way. The backend of this game is built using my own MVC framework Guardrail.

### Functionality & MVP

With Mini-lennium Falcon, users will be able to:
- [ ] Start, pause, resume, and reset the game.
- [ ] High scores will be saved in database.
- [ ] Modal to explain directions and rules
- [ ] Production README

### Wireframes

The app will be a single screen with links to the Github repo, my LinkedIn, portfolio, and the About modal. There will also be a button to toggle the sound which can also be toggled with 's'.
- Bonus: button to toggle through different ships to fly through space.
